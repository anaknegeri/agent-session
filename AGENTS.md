## Agent Session (mandatory workflow)

This project uses Agent Session (agent-session) as its session layer. Always follow this workflow:

1. When a session starts, FIRST call the agent-session MCP tools in order:
   - session.get — find the current session
   - context.get — load the current context
   Continue the existing task; do not start from scratch.
2. Record work as you go:
   - task.create / task.update — track the current task
   - decision.create — record architectural decisions with a reason
   - blocker.create — record blockers
   - event.append — record test results (test.failed / test.passed) and file.changed
3. Before finishing (Stop / session end), create a checkpoint:
   - session.checkpoint — include the next_action so the next agent can continue.
